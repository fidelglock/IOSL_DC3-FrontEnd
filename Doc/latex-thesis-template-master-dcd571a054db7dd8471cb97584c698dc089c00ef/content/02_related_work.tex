Historically messages were usually hand-delivered using a variety of methodologies, the most common being runners and horseback riders. Then came the introduction of mechanized courier services which differed from ordinary mail services by features such as speed, security,tracking and individualization of express services. They not only started providing such services within a town or a city but started offering worldwide services. The problem being very evident with such services is tracking these packages as stated above. Such offer services are made worldwide, typically with hub and spoke model. The spoke-hub distribution paradigm is a form of transport topology optimization in which the companies organize routes as a series of "spokes" that connect the outlying points to a central "hub"[1].

These companies further utilize courier software which provide electronic proof of delivery and electronic tracking details of the package limited to ownership. Currently the gap incorporated among logistic companies on cross country deliveries are handled using basic communication or with the help of some third party companies. Eurosender is one such  company that provides a platform for businesses and individuals to have a unified solution to run their logistics processes globally. They provide services for customers ranging from a simple package delivery to Freight transport. They also help their customers track the package based on individual  tracking numbers produced by each of the logistic companies for the delivery of the packages.
