The purpose of this documentation is to present our work on the Internet of services lab project. The project requirement was to develop a simple dashboard for web parcel management. To establish that we created an interface system that could be used by courier-companies\textbackslash customers\textbackslash postmen to monitor and update the status or the condition of the package. The package data is then stored on the blockchain to obtain ease of access to the data and consensus among the stakeholders, which implies that the data would be cross-company owned. To obtain the data from the blockchain to our dashboard we have also created a back-end communication level API.
This system also enables all parties involved in the package delivery to communicate with a single non-centralized source.
