We would like to express our deepest appreciation to all those who have helped us to successfully complete this project. A special gratitude to our supervisor Mr.Marcel MÃ¼ller, whose contribution in terms of guidance, advice and helping us to keep motivated throughout the project. 

It was a huge learning curve for all of us being a part of this team having members from different backgrounds and having unique skillsets. A special mention to Mohammed Haseeb Asif, who was of immense help to the team serving as a highly capable Project Manager with his years of impeccable experience in the Software Industry.

Finally we would like to thank the SNET faculty for providing us this great opportunity to work on the project with a set of enthusiastic team members and a great mentor. We would also like to thank all other mentors, friends, motivators, critiques, supporters and well-wishers who have helped us finalizing this project within the limited time frame.
